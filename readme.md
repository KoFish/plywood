# Plywood keymap

This keyboard userspace configuration is designed for a Lily58 and the code is based on splitkb's Aurora Lily58.

The userspace contains two different keymaps that uses tarmak-2 layout:

## Seniply

The design is loosly based on [Seniply](https://stevep99.github.io/seniply/) even tho it has diverged over time. It currenly also embeds [Tarmak-2](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/1858-learn-colemak-in-steps-with-the-tarmak-layouts/).

## Plywood

A new layout based on the need for symmetry. The core conceit is that you have a left and right layer that mirrors each other, so when you activate left layer you have navigation on the right hand side and oneshot modifiers on the left, and when you activate the right layer it's the other way around. This allows for lesser cognitive load on the memory while also making all useful keys accessible one-handed, to the cost of some redundancy and keys that probably will go largely unused.
